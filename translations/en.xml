Now that you have invited me to your server, you might want to set up some things. Right now only the server owner can use my restricted commands. But no worries, you can add admin permissions to others by assigning them a role named **Nano Admin**!

To begin a basic setup, type `!setup` as the server owner. It will help you set up some simple things.
After that, you might want to see `!commands` to get familiar with my commands.


By using me you agree that we may store some user data such as names of users, servers and channels to aid functionality. For more info, see `!tos`.</string>
